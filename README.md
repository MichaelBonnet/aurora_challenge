# aurora_challenge

Files for the C++ programming challenge sent to me by [Aurora Flight Sciences](https://www.aurora.aero/) during my application process. For an explanation of project specifications, see the `C++ Programming Challenge 9_30_21.docx` file.

**Usage**

`$ make`

`$ ./uavs`

**Future Work**

* May add more unit tests.
* May add a senderID-receiverID matching check.

**Acknowledgements**

I received extremely appreciated advice on architecture from two of my previous professors at the University of Texas at Arlington, Trevor Bakker and George Rice.
